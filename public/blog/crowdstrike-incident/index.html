        <p>What is something you expect when you get to the office on a Friday morning in IT? Personally, I expect to have an easy day going into the weekend as I got most of my work done during the week.</p>
<p>Today, however, when I got into the office I was met by hundreds of emails and my Microsoft Teams going crazy. After sifting through all the emails from end users notifying us that services were not working, I looked at my co-worker and asked what happened. I was met with a brief &ldquo;Crowdstrike Happened&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Crowdstrike is a name I have never heard of before so after looking up the topic, I discovered they had a large, and I mean LARGE footprint. Flights have been grounded, banks are down, courts are closed, it&rsquo;s a mess. This post isn&rsquo;t meant to harass Crowdstrike or anyone involved with this mistake but to inform and poke fun at a situation that I was not expecting on my Friday morning.</p>
<p>For context, Crowdstrike is a cyber security firm out of Austin Texas. Crowdstrike provides cloud workload protection and endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services.</p>
<p>The issue was confirmed to be caused by a defect in a software content update by Crowdstrike. The specific issue was with their falcon sensor that is used to detect attacks such as malware.</p>
<p>To give credit where credit is due, they had a fairly quick response and recovery time. It is also worth noting, Crowdstrike confirmed this was an error on their end and not caused by an attack. This was re-assurring from all the news about companies getting hacked in the last week or so.</p>
<p>This is a late post so it may not be helpful but if anyone stumbles upon this and is looking for a manual solution, below are the steps provided by Crowdstrike to remediaite this issue manually.</p>
<ol>
<li>boot into save mode
a. NOTE: connect the host with a network cable and not wi-fi</li>
<li>Navigate to the %WINDIR%\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory</li>
<li>locate the file matching &ldquo;C-00000291*.sys&rdquo;, and delete it</li>
<li>Boot the host normally</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an unfortunate event to kick off our Friday but I hope everyone has a better weekend.</p>

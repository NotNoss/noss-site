      <description>Noss Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Noss, a college student studying Computer Science and an IT professional with around 4 years of experience behind me just in the career. My hobby with tech predates that by a long time.
I am a hobbiest programmer and homelaber.
This site serves as a place for me to discuss the things I am learning, my experiences and anything else that intrigues me.
There is no guarantee of anything being added on a schedule due to a busy life working full time and attending college.</description>

      <description>Backstory Since I was 16, I have had back issues. When I was 19, I was officially diagnosed with scholiosis. This causes pain all over my body but can usually start from my lower back or my shoulders/neck area. I actively make changes in my lifestyle in an attempt to avoid the pain that I endur everyday. Two years ago, I was working and couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold my mouse or type on my keyboard without pain shooting through my arms.</description>

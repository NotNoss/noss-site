      <description>Noss Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Noss, a college student studying Computer Science and an IT professional with around 4 years of experience behind me just in the career. My hobby with tech predates that by a long time.
I am a hobbiest programmer and homelaber.
This site serves as a place for me to discuss the things I am learning, my experiences and anything else that intrigues me.
There is no guarantee of anything being added on a schedule due to a busy life working full time and attending college.</description>

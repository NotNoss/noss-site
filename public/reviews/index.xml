      <description>Backstory Since I was 16, I have had back issues. When I was 19, I was officially diagnosed with scholiosis. This causes pain all over my body but can usually start from my lower back or my shoulders/neck area. I actively make changes in my lifestyle in an attempt to avoid the pain that I endur everyday. Two years ago, I was working and couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold my mouse or type on my keyboard without pain shooting through my arms.</description>

# Noss
Hello, I'm Noss, a college student studying Computer Science and an IT professional with around 4 years of experience behind me just in the career. My hobby with tech predates that by a long time.

I am a hobbiest programmer and homelaber.

This site serves as a place for me to discuss the things I am learning, my experiences and anything else that intrigues me.

There is no guarantee of anything being added on a schedule due to a busy life working full time and attending college.

This is a place for me to teach what I learn, however, he is constantly learning and does not know everything. This site will be a public repo as well as hosting comments. If there is something I can do better or is generally wrong about. Please let me know or you can submit a PR to fix it in order to provide the most accurate information possible.

DISCLAIMER: Technology is an ever changing field. Things are subject to change. Any guide may not be entirely accurate so always check dates before following one. I will try and keep up with them as much as possible but I may not be able to keep up with them all.

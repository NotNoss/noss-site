## Overview
The Keebio Iris Rev 8 is a split ergonomic keyboard by Keebio. This is my first split or even ergonomic keyboard but I have really enjoyed the month I’ve been using the iris and will likely continue using it but I do now have my eyes on some others with less keys already.

## Purchasing Experience
The main part you’re needing from Keebio is the PCB, stand offs and screws (I’m sure you can get your own stand offs and screws as well but I have not looked into it) as they offer files to CNC or 3D print your own case. The switches and key caps can also be your own. I love that Keebio allows you to choose which parts you want to purchase incase you don’t want to go with their plates, middle layer etc.

## Hardware
Enough about what I like about the company and their website, let’s talk about the device. It’s DIY so you have to put it together but it’s as easy as screwing everything together. The only complaint I have hardware wise isn’t anything bad on the keyboard but some keys are more difficult to press with my hands. The keyboard is QMK compatible which offers a huge amount of customization.

## Software
In terms of software, you have a few options. [via](usevia.app), [qmk](https://qmk.fm/) and [vial](https://get.vial.today/). Via is simple to use, use a chrome browser, go to the website and make your changes. This does not offer lots of customization but is great for beginners to make simple changes. QMK is harder to use but it’s the best by far in customization. QMK has to be written in C and then compiled before flashing it on your device. Lastly is Vial, vial is a good middle ground whereas it offers more customization then via but it’s easier then QMK. I’m not going to go into too much detail on using any of them but you can check out my vial configuration here.

## Conclusion
The Keebio Iris Rev 8 is a great keyboard especially for beginners. The price makes it an attractive starting point for beginners. I can see myself using this keyboard for a while but will likely eventually look at a smaller one with less keys.
